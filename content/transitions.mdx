_Transitions_ is a condensed retelling of my growing up with gender dysphoria and much of what has followed as a result of that. It includes my experiences as someone who transitioned into attempting to live as a woman and ultimately detransitioned away from living as trans.

Warning: includes strobe effects which may trigger photosensitive epilepsy.
